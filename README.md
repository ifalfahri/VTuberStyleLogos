# VTuberStyleLogos
>_Cute VTuber-style logos I made for fun_

I created this because I love the VTuber-style logos made by amazing designers in the community and use them frequently. Recently, I've been working a lot with Webflow and GSAP but couldn't find those kinds of logos for them, so I decided to make them myself.
